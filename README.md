Title: SAFESPOT: Smart Tracking Device

Description:

SAFESPOT is a project that aims to develop a smart tracking device for real-time location monitoring. It utilizes a Neo-6M GPS module for accurate positioning and a SIM800L GSM module for cellular network communication.

Features:

GPS Tracking: Leverages the Neo-6M module to acquire and transmit location data.
GSM Communication: Employs the SIM800L module to send location data via cellular network. (Consider mentioning cellular network compatibility, e.g., 2G, 3G, etc., if applicable)
Project Structure:

This repository is organized with separate branches for different project stages:

synopsis_presentation: Contains materials specific to the synopsis presentation (e.g., slides, notes, key points).
midterm_presentation: Houses resources for the midterm presentation (e.g., updated slides, demos, progress reports).
endterm_presentation: Includes final presentation materials (e.g., refined slides, detailed demonstrations, final report).
